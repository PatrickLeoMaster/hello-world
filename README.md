# hello-world
This is my first repository on Git Hub, I would like to see what can I obtain from this world famous programmer platform

Ha Ha, I start to make some changes...I found that...Git Uses other Branches to do some saved changes and then do the real commits to the Master Branch as soon as you done your modification.
